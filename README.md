# NurseYou---Optum-Stratethon_Season-2_Submission
 Our app is powered by an IoT device, an image processing algorithm, and AI. This app can act as a monitor for patients at home who are suffering from illness and require special attention from caretakers/guardian and doctors at home.

## RoboCare app: 
PROBLEMS FACED:
1. Patients faces issues of approachability, availability and affordability when it comes to receiving care at hospitals.
2. Even when the patient can receive care, things can go wrong as it becomes more and more difficult for hospitals to provide proper care owing to shortage of nurses and doctors.
3. Also many patients like senior citizens, with cerebral palsy, paralyzed needs 24/7 care as they cannot communicate because of physical disability. But most of the people cannot afford it due to the higher cost.
4. Due to this reason they often land to bad healthcare which lead to other serious problems like exposure to allergic food.
5. Unavailability of fitness apps and programs
6. Mobility assistance 
7. Unavailability  of emergency alarms

**Our app is powered by an IoT device, an image processing algorithm, and AI. This app can act as a monitor for patients at home who are suffering from illness and require special attention from caretakers/guardian and doctors at home.**
Our App keeps the track of patient’s health factors like (BODY TEMPERATURE AND HEARTBEAT) for doctors and patients’ caretakers at home, which are monitored using hardware IoT sensors. also we have built a robot to transfer essential good to patients keeping social distancing in mind (Due to COVID19) which moves following gestures by hand. Also this can be used as a wheelchair for week senior citizen patients and cerebral palsy people with paralysis. And in final touch we devised an Image learning algorithm which is connected to the firebase cloud storage and give alerts in app when the patient make face gesture, or when there is a DROOLING action in cerebral palsy patients, to call for help since they can’t speak distinctly and moving their mouth, or a simple gesture will do good for these patients.

**An alarm is sounded to the caretaker/doctor using the app.**
1. When the heartbeat/pulse crosses a threshold.
2. When the body temperature is above the normal body temperature
3. When the patient shows signs of distress monitored by a camera and detected by image processing algorithms and AI detecting (open mouth gesture) which indicates drooling in cerebral palsy patients and discomfort in elderly handicapped people.
