*support for patients with Color Blindness : Our UI also allows patients to change the primary and secondary UI colors so that they can clearly distinguish between the elements present in the UI and choose an interface with colors friendly to the eye.
What we are looking to implement:
We have developed a typing system in Javascript, wherein disabled users can type messages using hover feature, head movements to track eye-blink pointer. This software can be integrated with a special type of keyboard which will work in O(log n) time complexity i.e., one word nearly in 4 head movement... something which can be used by people with motor neuron disease as seen in the late Stephen Hawking. We are still in the process of implementing the functionality in our web app

Implementing a news section wherein people get daily updates about trends in medicine, by calling an external API.

Implementing Speech to text system wherin we can leverage Natural Language Processing techniques and tools like Facebook's Wit.ai to capture the intent of the doctors communicated message and update patient records in medical prescription, surgery, patient history, along with the timestamp, wherein doctors don't have to spend time writing patient records on paper/documents but it can be updated using Speech to Text.
